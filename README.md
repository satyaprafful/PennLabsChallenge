# Server Challenge Documentation 
As a general overview, almost all the functions are implemented and well commented on within index.py. Certain lines of code are commented out because of a lack of a Database. 

This is my first dive into anything to do with Web Development and many of the concepts are still relatively unfamiliar, but I'm hoping I've demonstrated at least a few good things! (I did not really touch the front-end though, so it still looks pretty rudimentary).

## Additional Feature Implementation: Search
* Files: Templates, forms.py 
* A search feature has been implemented through route 'api/clubs/search'
* It's pretty intuitive to use 
* Currently lacks a full club database, but allows for searches through "Club name" and "Keywords"
* Presently returns "No results found"
* The functionality is supported by a HTML Template and a Jinja macro  

## General Instructions 
1. Clone the repo 
2. Run index.py with Flask virtual environment running 
3. Access the locally hosted adddress and navigate the various urls 
4. Enjoy!
